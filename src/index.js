    <p>My first experience with tech was in graduate school when I learned about Linux in order to install it on a cheap laptop. This sparked my interest to learn more about technology as a means to help people. Since then I graduated from the Flatiron School becoming a fullstack developer with experience working with JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, React/Redux, HTML5, CSS. My coding philosophy is that functionality and style should be interconnected, and that the best code is written by people who are always learning.</p>`
